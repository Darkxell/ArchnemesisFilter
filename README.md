# ArchnemesisFilter

Filter for archnemesis Items in Path of Exile<br>
Highlights good bases and dim lower value ones. <br><br><br>

Does not completely hide any part. Highlighted drop only parts are Gargantuan (currency), Vampiric (fossils and useful combines), anything for Treant (Rewards duplication), and anything for mirror image (Scarab rewards). By just picking up what's highlighted, you will not be able to complete high maintenance recepies (as they need almost everything and cannot be filtered), but will be optimising currency drops for time spent.<br><br>
Features tiering of combined recepies, and custom drop sound for the very rare opulent mod part for challenge and rewards.
